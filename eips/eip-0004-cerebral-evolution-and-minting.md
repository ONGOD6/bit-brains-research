## Abstract

This EIP defines the Cerebral NFT layer within the Bit Brains ecosystem. Cerebrals function as the primary interface for staking, reward distribution, identity signaling, and future autonomous intelligence development.

This proposal establishes the structure, purpose, reward pathways, phase progression, expansion mechanics, and royalty routing for the Cerebral layer.

This EIP additionally recognizes a Genesis Ethscriptions participation rail (Pickle Punks) that may progress into Cerebrals by satisfying the same Proof of Care and continuity requirements as Genesis Brains. The protocol’s phases, continuity gates, and reward settlement rules do not change; the Pickle Punk rail is additive.

---

## Motivation

The Bit Brains protocol is designed to reward long-term alignment, continuity, and constructive participation over time.

This EIP introduces Cerebrals to:
- Expand participation without diluting core stewardship
- Enable staking-based reward distribution
- Support identity, ENS, and signaling primitives
- Create a progression path toward economic and autonomous utility

The protocol also introduces Ethscriptions as a Genesis asset rail. Ethscriptions are immutable inscriptions with provenance anchored to Ethereum calldata. This EIP provides an additive pathway for Ethscriptions (Pickle Punks) to evolve into the Cerebral layer through the same Proof of Care and continuity requirements as Brains, preserving protocol integrity while enabling Ethscriptions-based evolution.

---

## Definitions

- **Brain**  
  The genesis NFT representing the earliest and longest-lived commitment to the Bit Brains ecosystem.

- **Pickle Punk (Ethscription)**  
  A Genesis Headshot Ethscription recognized by the protocol as an eligible Proof of Care participant and progression primitive. Pickle Punks are immutable calldata inscriptions and do not mutate; progression occurs by minting protocol-defined derived assets.

- **Cerebral**  
  An ERC-721 NFT derived from Genesis Brains, Genesis Ethscriptions (Pickle Punks), or authorized Expansion Epochs, serving as a staking, participation, and progression primitive.

- **Proof of Care (PoC)**  
  Sustained participation, staking continuity, and ecosystem-aligned behavior maintained across defined epochs within a phase, validated by ZK accountability.

- **Phase**  
  A protocol lifecycle stage (e.g., Brain Phase, Cerebral Phase, Brainiac Phase) consisting of five (5) epochs.

- **Epoch**  
  A time-bounded accountability interval (approximately one month) within a phase, during which ZK proofs evaluate continuity, PoC signatures, and non-interference.

- **Expansion Epoch**  
  A governance-authorized event introducing additional Cerebrals to support ecosystem growth and broader participation.

- **Real World Assets (RWA)**  
  Tokenized or represented economic activities, goods, or services that exist outside purely digital systems.

## Cerebral Overview

Cerebrals are ERC-721 NFTs that represent active participation within the Bit Brains ecosystem. They serve as the primary interface for staking, reward distribution, identity signaling, and future autonomous intelligence development.

Cerebrals may be:
- Earned through Genesis Brain participation (Genesis entitlement path)
- Earned through Genesis Pickle Punk participation (Ethscriptions progression path)
- Minted during authorized Expansion Epochs (Public + Treasury allocations)
- Utilized for staking and reward accrual
- Evolved into higher-order components over time

---

## Genesis Assets and Participation Rails (Additive)

At Genesis, the protocol introduces two additive asset rails into the ecosystem:

- **Genesis Brains (ERC-721)** — stake-bearing Genesis assets
- **Genesis Pickle Punks (Ethscriptions)** — immutable calldata inscriptions eligible for Proof of Care participation

The protocol’s phases, epoch structure, continuity evaluation, and reward settlement rules do not change. Both rails progress through the same Proof of Care and continuity evaluation framework.

---

## Genesis Cerebrals

Each **Brain** is entitled to mint up to **two (2) Genesis Cerebrals** through defined staking and participation mechanics.

Genesis Cerebrals represent early alignment and inherit preferential reward pathways relative to later Expansion participants, subject to Proof of Care requirements.

---

## Pickle Punk Cerebrals (Ethscriptions Evolution Path)

Each **Pickle Punk (Ethscription)** may become eligible to mint up to **two (2) Genesis Cerebrals** by completing the same Proof of Care and continuity requirements required for Genesis Brain progression.

Ethscriptions do not mutate. “Evolution” is achieved by minting a derived ERC-721 Cerebral that permanently references the originating Pickle Punk inscription as provenance.

---

## Progression and Minting Eligibility (Brains and Pickle Punks)

Brains and Pickle Punks may progress into Cerebrals by satisfying protocol-defined Proof of Care and continuity requirements.

### Eligibility requirements (global)

A participant must:
- Sign Proof of Care and continuity commitments as required by protocol
- Maintain uninterrupted continuity across the defined eligibility window
- Pass ZK accountability validation across epochs
- Resolve the protocol-required ENS identity used for eligibility and reward routing

### Continuity requirement for Genesis Cerebral eligibility

Full continuity must be maintained continuously throughout **Phase 2 (Cerebral Phase), Epochs 1–5**.

Partial participation or early withdrawal during **Phase 2 Epochs 1–5** disqualifies the participant from full (two) Genesis Cerebral eligibility.

> Note: For Brain holders, “withdrawal” refers to breaking required staking continuity.  
> For Pickle Punk holders, “withdrawal” refers to breaking the protocol-defined continuity commitments and/or failing Proof of Care validation for the eligibility window.

---

## ENS Identity and Routing (Canonical)

All reward routing and progression eligibility MUST use ENS as the canonical identity layer.

Participants MUST resolve the protocol-defined ENS subdomain to a wallet they control in order to:
- Receive rewards
- Claim eligibility
- Mint derived progression assets (e.g., Cerebrals)

ENS requirements and derivation formats are specified elsewhere and are normative for this EIP’s eligibility logic.

---

## Provenance Binding Requirement (Ethscriptions → Cerebral)

When a Cerebral is minted from a Pickle Punk (Ethscription), the Cerebral mint MUST permanently bind provenance to:

- The originating Pickle Punk inscription reference (identifier / provenance hash), and
- The canonical ENS identity used for eligibility

A Pickle Punk may be used to mint Cerebrals only according to protocol rules and MUST not permit unlimited derived mints.

---

## Expansion Cerebrals

To support ecosystem growth and broader participation, the protocol authorizes Expansion Cerebrals through governance-approved Expansion Epochs.

Expansion Cerebrals:
- Are minted under defined supply constraints
- Receive lower base reward pathways than Genesis Cerebrals
- Retain the ability to increase reward capacity through sustained Proof of Care

---

## Expansion Epoch I — Public & Treasury Allocations

- **Total Cerebrals Minted:** 1,500  
- **Public Mint Allocation:** 1,350  
- **Team Treasury Allocation:** 50  
- **Reward Treasury Allocation:** 150  

Treasury-allocated Cerebrals are reserved exclusively for protocol-defined purposes, including:
- Long-term reward sustainability
- Ecosystem incentives and onboarding
- Contributor recognition
- Community-driven growth initiatives

---

## Secondary Market Royalty Structure (Expansion Epoch I)

All Expansion Epoch I Cerebrals are subject to a **3% secondary market royalty**, enforced at the contract level and distributed as follows:

- **1% → Reward Treasury**
- **1% → Artist**
- **1% → Founder**

These royalties reinforce long-term rewards funding, support creative contributors, and sustain protocol stewardship.

---

## Brain Holder Rendered Cerebral Artifacts

Brain holders may be entitled to receive a rendered Cerebral NFT representing symbolic and cultural linkage to the Cerebral layer.

Rendered Cerebral artifacts:
- Are art-focused NFTs
- May include an ENS-linked subdomain identifier
- Do not confer staking rights
- Do not emit rewards
- Do not participate in governance

These artifacts exist solely as identity and cultural primitives and do not constitute functional Cerebrals.

---

## Reward Distribution Framework

Cerebrals participate in protocol reward distribution through staking and epoch-based mechanisms. Reward emissions are sourced from fee allocations, royalty flows, and phase-defined distributions.

### Phase-based reward settlement (global rule)

Rewards are distributed **after every Phase**, not mid-phase.

Each Phase consists of **five (5) epochs**, with each epoch representing approximately **one (1) month** of participation. During each epoch, Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) systems perform accountability analysis to validate:
- Staking continuity (where applicable)
- Proof of Care signatures
- Non-interference behavior
- Continuity commitments

No rewards are distributed mid-phase.

### Phase 1 — Brain Phase (first unlock + BIT emergence)

During **Phase 1**, BIT rewards are distributed to participants who:
- Are eligible under protocol rules, and
- Maintain Proof of Care and continuity commitments throughout Epochs 1–5, and
- Satisfy ENS routing requirements

ZKP accountability runs monthly across **Epochs 1–5**.

**At the end of Phase 1 (Epoch 5),** following completion of ZKP validation, rewards are finalized.  
Within approximately **two (2) weeks into Epoch 6**, the protocol distributes Phase 1 rewards, marking the first emergence and distribution of the **Brain Intelligence Token (BIT)** within the Bit Brains ecosystem.

### Subsequent phases

Each subsequent Phase follows the same structure:
- Five epochs of participation and ZKP accountability
- Reward eligibility determined by Proof of Care and staking/continuity requirements
- Reward distribution occurs only after the final epoch of the Phase concludes

Epochs serve as accountability and analysis intervals, while Phases serve as reward settlement boundaries.

---

## Reward Pathway Hierarchy and Proof of Care

The Bit Brains protocol prioritizes continuity, stewardship, and long-term participation over short-term extraction.

Brains represent the earliest and longest-lived commitment within the ecosystem.

Cerebrals form the second-order participation layer and receive meaningful rewards, with clear pathway differentiation:
- **Genesis Cerebrals:** preferential pathways (earned via Genesis participation + Phase 2 continuity)
- **Expansion Cerebrals:** public-access pathways (lower base than Genesis, upgradeable via Proof of Care)

Pickle Punk progression into Genesis Cerebrals is governed by the same Proof of Care and continuity requirements and does not alter the underlying reward settlement rules.

---

## Phase Progression and Eligibility Summary

### Phase 1 — Brain Phase
- Participants commit to Proof of Care + continuity.
- ZKP accountability runs monthly across Epochs 1–5.
- **Rewards are distributed after Epoch 5**, within ~two weeks into Epoch 6 (first BIT emergence).

### Phase 2 — Cerebral Phase
Participants become eligible to mint up to **two (2) Genesis Cerebrals** if they:
- Maintain uninterrupted continuity across **Phase 2 Epochs 1–5**
- Satisfy protocol staking requirements where applicable
- Resolve ENS identity requirements

Failure to maintain continuity may reduce eligibility per protocol rules.

### Phase 3 — Brainiac Phase (eligibility outcome)
At completion of Phase 2:
- **Two (2) Brainiacs** may be spawned if continuity requirements were fully maintained
- **One (1) Brainiac** may be spawned if partial continuity requirements were maintained

This structure rewards maximum continuity while allowing partial participation paths.

---

## Supply and Emissions Context

The Bit token has a maximum supply of **200,000,000 BIT**.

Cerebral rewards are not guaranteed, fixed, or unconditional.

---

## Security Considerations

Cerebrals introduce staking and reward mechanisms that require safeguards against:
- Reward manipulation
- Sybil behavior
- Premature extraction

Safeguards and audits will be addressed in future EIPs.

---

## Governance Considerations

Changes to Cerebral issuance, allocation, royalties, or reward pathways are subject to governance processes defined elsewhere.

---

## Conclusion

This EIP defines the Cerebral layer as a progression-based participation and reward system that prioritizes continuity, ZK-verified Proof of Care, and long-term stewardship within the Bit Brains ecosystem.

Ethscriptions (Pickle Punks) are integrated as an additive Genesis rail that may evolve into Cerebrals by meeting the same Proof of Care and continuity requirements, without changing the protocol’s underlying phase structure or reward settlement rules.
